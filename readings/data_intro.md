Five words that come to your mind when you hear "data" and "mouse".

- Data -> information, record, statistics, privacy, breach

- Mouse -> rodent, computer, technology, click, lab

When we think of the word data, there are certain words that come to mind. For me, the first few words I think of when I hear data are information, record, statistics, privacy, and breach. However, these words are all relevant to location, time, and perspective. Data first appeared as a thing that is given in the world of religion and mathematics. Over time, the word data has been heavily associated with many other realms including statistics, technology, and later to google, humans, bias, ethics, and power. In the future, data may be more closely associated with privacy, rights, and voice. I believe that as people are becoming more aware that data is taken and not given, it will create more conversations about the intended use for this data and how it affects our daily lives. If we acknowledge the taking of data as harmful and the pre-existing biases in data systems, only then will we have a voice to fight for our rights to privacy and protection of ourselves.

Data bias is when data is chosen in ways that lead to a misrepresentation of “real-world” information. An example of data bias can be something as simple as a hand drying machine. There was one case of a hand drying machine that did not function properly when people with darker complexion tried to use it. In this case, there is a selection bias when it comes to testing the product, making it less accessible to everyone. Before the product was launched, it probably went through many tests and passed but the tests run were not inclusive and only measured a small part of the community. In this way, we can see that “data is reductive” because this machine may have had a 100% pass rate in testing but in reality failed to account for everybody.
