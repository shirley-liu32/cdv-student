# Three Datasets

## Jail Deaths in America
*[Jail Deaths in America Dataset](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-graphic/)*
Reuters contains details about more than 7,500 inmate deaths between 2008 and 2019, including the cause of death, custody status, and demographic information. The federal government doesn’t publish jail-by-jail mortality data and I think it's important to know what the conditions are, and how and why so many people are dying in prison while awaiting trial. 

## New York City Languages
*[NYC Languages Dataset](https://languagemap.nyc/Data)* 
The Endangered Language Alliance’s Languages of New York City map includes around 700 languages and dialects spoken in NYC and nearby counties. I think it would be cool to visualize the data on a map as well as have sections of information for each language. Each part would indicate the linguistic family, countries of origin, estimated number of global speakers, and sites spoken in NYC.

## Super Bowl Ads
*[Super Bowl Ads Dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/superbowl-ads/blob/main/superbowl-ads.csv)* 
 This dataset collected by Five Thirty Eight contains information on 233 Super Bowl ads run by 10 frequently-advertising brands between 2000 and 2020. It would interesting to see what companies are doing for their very expensive commerical slot. I could show what categories they focused on when proudcing the add, “Was it trying to be funny?” and “Did it include animals?”
